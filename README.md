# Test Coverage Summary Report Action

This action will report test coverage summary of the touched files within a pull request description. It works with the json coverage-summary generated by `Istanbul` reporter.

## Inputs

### `token`
**Required** The GitHub authentication token (workflows automatically set this for you, nothing needed here)

### `path`
**Required** Path to the Istanbul 'coverage-summary.json' file in your repo

### `title`
**Required** Title of the report 


## Outputs

### `summary`
Summary of the report in json format
```json
{
    "lines": { "total": number, "covered": number, "skipped": number, "pct": number },
    "functions": { "total": number, "covered": number, "skipped": number, "pct": number },
    "statements": { "total": number, "covered": number, "skipped": number, "pct": number },
    "branches": { "total": number, "covered": number, "skipped": number, "pct": number }
}
```

## Preparation
Setup your test framework to use `Istanbul` to create coverage report as json file and thats it. just feed that file to this action as an input.
